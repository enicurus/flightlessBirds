###all these functions require phytools###
###species must be in quotes and contain the full name, ie "Alca_torda"###
###tree must be a set of trees of class "multiPhylo"###
###To use with add.family.to.tip, add the family name to species ie "Alcidae_Alca_torda"###


### Add a species randomly to its genus, halfway down the branch it connects to, with different placements across trees###

 newTree<-lapply(tree,add.species.to.genus,species,where="random") ###



###To add species randomly in their family (as opposed to genus; this is most helpful for species in extinct genera)###
###Taxa is a list of taxa defining the family imported from a .csv file###
###family must be in quotes###

add.family.to.tip<-function(tree,family,taxa){
	sp<-as.vector(taxa[,1])
	taxon<-as.list(sp)
	for (i in 1:length(taxon))
	tree$tip.label[tree$tip.label==taxon[i]]<-as.character(paste(family,taxon[[i]],sep="_"))
	return(tree)
}


###This function relies on the previous function but iterates ovr multiple trees###
 newTree<-lapply(tree,add.family.to.tip,family,taxa) 


### family names can then be removed from tips in TextWrangler with the regular expression: ###
### find \w+_(\w+_\w+) replace with \1 ###
